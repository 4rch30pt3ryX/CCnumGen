This is a tool to generate very large amounts random, unique and most importantly, viable(!) Credit Card numbers for testing purposes. Attention ne'er-do-wells! This does not provide any tool to create the 3 digit security pin on the back. The luhn algorithm is not a clandestine encryption tool, but merely a checksum to validate a card in an additional way.
